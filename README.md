# Python script for calculating subnets
## Given an arbitary IPv4 address and subnet mask or CIDR, this script will calculate:
## - The size of the address space
## - The number of usable host addresses
## - The network ID and broadcast address
## - The first and last host address

# TODO:
## - Implement functionality for IPv6
## - Add functionality for IPv4 VLSM calculations
